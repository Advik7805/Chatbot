# Predictive Maintenance and Optimization System

## Problem Statement
Industrial systems often face unexpected downtimes and inefficiencies due to lack of timely maintenance and optimization insights. This leads to increased operational costs and reduced productivity.

## Current Progress
- Developed a prototype that collects and displays real-time system data.
- Integrated an interactive chatbot to assist users in understanding system status and optimization strategies.

## How the Prototype Solves the Problem
- **Data Visualization:** The system presents key metrics and trends, enabling proactive maintenance decisions.
- **Interactive Chatbot:** Users can interact with the chatbot to get explanations about system data and receive personalized optimization tips, making the system accessible to both technical and non-technical users.

## Tech Stack
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Chatbot:** Custom logic integrated with backend
- **Data Handling:** REST APIs

## Instructions to Run

### Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm i
npm start
```

### Frontend
Open `index.html` with Go Live (VS Code extension) or any local server:
